- **Visual Hierarchy**: Key elements such as headings, buttons, and links are designed to stand out, creating a clear visual hierarchy that guides users through their interactions with the application.

### User Experience Enhancements

#### URL Slugs for Recipe Details
To enhance the user experience and improve SEO (Search Engine Optimisation), we implemented a URL slug feature for individual recipe pages. Instead of displaying the recipe ID or a generic query parameter in the URL, users can now see a human-readable URL that includes the recipe title. This not only makes the URLs more descriptive but also easier to share.

For example, when a user clicks on a recipe, the URL changes from:

`/recipes/1` to `/recipes/chocolate-chip-cookies`

**Steps taken:**
1. **Slug Field in the Model:** We added a slug field to the `Recipe` model, which automatically generates a URL-friendly version of the recipe title.
2. **Slug Generation:** Slugs are generated using Django's `slugify` function when a recipe is created or updated.
3. **URL Configuration:** The recipe detail page's URL pattern was updated to accept slugs instead of the numeric ID, ensuring a cleaner and more user-friendly URL structure.
4. **Navigation Links Updated:** All links to individual recipes were updated to point to the new slug-based URLs.

This enhancement improves the website's usability, makes URLs more memorable, and optimises the site for search engines.


#### Pagination for Recipes
We implemented pagination to break down the list of recipes into multiple pages. This improves loading performance and provides a more structured browsing experience for users. By default, the recipe listing page now shows a limited number of recipes per page, with controls to navigate between pages.

#### Cloudinary Integration
We integrated Cloudinary for image hosting, which allows you to upload and display high-quality images for recipes. This enhances the visual appeal of the site, especially on the recipe detail pages, where images are displayed.

#### Heroku Deployment
The project is deployed on Heroku, and we ensured that the necessary environment variables (like the Cloudinary API keys) are set correctly in Heroku’s configuration to support image hosting and ensure smooth functionality.

#### Dropdown Menu for Recipe Categories
A dropdown menu was added to allow users to view and select categories when they visit a recipe’s page. This categorisation helps users quickly identify and navigate between different types of recipes, like “Dessert,” “Main Course,” or “Vegetarian.”

#### Fixing Static File and CSS Issues on Heroku
We encountered issues with CSS and image formatting when deployed to Heroku. These issues were resolved by ensuring that static files were properly collected and that Cloudinary image URLs were correctly configured.

       - Title
       - Description
       - Ingredients
       - Instructions
       - Cooking Time
       - Servings
       - Category
     - The test ensures that the form is valid and that the cleaned data matches the expected values.
   - **Invalid Recipe Form Test:**
     - This test verifies the form's behaviour with invalid data, checking for:
       - Title length exceeding the character limit.
       - Description length exceeding the limit.
       - Missing ingredients and instructions.
       - Negative values for cooking time and servings.
       - Missing category.
     - The test ensures that appropriate error messages are returned for each invalid field.

2. **Slug Generation Tests:**
   - **Slug Creation on Save:**
     - This test ensures that a slug is automatically generated from the recipe title upon saving the recipe.
     - It also checks that the `featured_image` field contains the expected URL format.
     - **Change Made:** During testing, we used a mocked image URL from Cloudinary (`http://example.com/fake-image.jpg`) to simulate image uploads, reflecting our integration with Cloudinary while maintaining a consistent testing environment.

3. **Recipe View Tests:**
   - **Create Recipe View Test:**
     - This test verifies that the recipe creation view is accessible and functions correctly for logged-in users.
     - It ensures that the user is redirected to the login page if they attempt to access the recipe creation page while logged out.
   - **Recipe List View Pagination Test:**
     - This test checks that the pagination feature of the recipe list view works as intended, ensuring that a set number of recipes (6 in this case) is displayed per page.

### Bug Fixes

Throughout the development of the Recipe Manager project, several bugs and issues were identified and resolved to enhance the application's functionality and user experience. Below are the notable bugs that were fixed along with the solutions implemented:

#### 1. **Image Display Issues on Heroku**
   - **Issue:** Images uploaded using Cloudinary were not displaying correctly on Heroku, appearing distorted or missing entirely.
   - **Solution:** The issue was traced back to the incorrect formatting of Cloudinary URLs in the application. By reviewing the code that handled image URLs, we ensured that the correct Cloudinary image path was used and removed any unnecessary transformations. This adjustment allowed the images to render correctly in the deployed application.

#### 2. **User Authentication Issues**
   - **Issue:** Users experienced difficulties logging in or signing up, particularly related to username handling.
   - **Solution:** After implementing Django Allauth for authentication, we found that usernames were not being saved correctly. We addressed this by setting `ACCOUNT_USERNAME_REQUIRED = True` in the `settings.py` file, ensuring that usernames were mandatory during the signup process. This change allowed for smoother user registration and login experiences.

#### 3. **Pagination in Recipe List View**
   - **Issue:** The pagination functionality for the recipe list view was not returning the expected number of recipes per page.
   - **Solution:** We discovered that the view function was not correctly passing the paginated object to the template. By updating the view to properly handle pagination, we ensured that the correct number of recipes (6 per page) was displayed, enhancing usability for users browsing through multiple recipes.

#### 4. **Slug Generation Failures**
   - **Issue:** Slugs for recipes were not being generated as expected upon saving new recipes.
   - **Solution:** We implemented unit tests to verify the slug generation logic. After identifying that the slug was not being created consistently, we modified the recipe model to ensure that the slug was derived from the recipe title during the save process. This fix improved the consistency of recipe URLs, making them more user-friendly.


## Deployment

The project was deployed using Heroku. Below is the deployment process:

1. Create a new Heroku app.
2. Link the Heroku app to the GitHub repository.

### Project Setup

After setting up the project and running migrations, you can load predefined recipes into the database for faster testing or to populate the website with sample content.

1. **Run Migrations**: Ensure your database is up to date by running the following command:

    ```bash
    python manage.py migrate
    ```

2. **Load Predefined Recipes**: To quickly populate your database with sample recipes, use the `loaddata` command with the `recipes.json` file. This file contains predefined recipe entries that will help you see how the application behaves with actual data. Run the following command:

    ```bash
    python manage.py loaddata recipes.json
    ```

   This command will read the data from `recipes.json` and insert it into your database, creating two sample recipes: "Spaghetti Carbonara" and "Chicken Curry." You can modify or add more recipes to this JSON file as needed.

3. **Verify the Data**: After loading the data, you can check the Django admin panel to see the recipes listed under the Recipes section. This will allow you to quickly verify that your setup is working correctly.

By following these steps, you will have a functional setup with sample data ready for testing and development.
